# SmartGrid
A web based application where we can give and take services. It is to provide e-services platform, ease of finding locations and emergency handling platforms.



The conversation about SmartGrid tends to focus on technology, but there’s a
lot more to it. The main problem behind the problem is that as urban life is
evolving in population and needs, so is the need to incorporate technology
into our daily lives. We’re now in a situation wherein the economic and social
environment is fractured, many citizens distrust the government to provide
efficient and effective services to its population.
We need to build such products like SmartGrid to get the commute, lives and
urban experience better. What do we do? We build SmartGrid and provide an e-services platform, ease of finding locations and emergency handling
platforms. The vision is to incorporate citizens and tourists coming to a
particular region into the application and provide them ease in their daily life
functioning.
The problem statement is that we need such platforms
and applications which incorporate technology into our daily lives and save
the time and energy of residents and tourists of our so called utopia. The
promise of the SmartGrid is one of the digitally-enabled data-driven,
responsive and integrated urban environment and a manageable entity.

Next, talking about the key features of SmartGrid; all have been identified and
defined thoroughly. They constitute:
● Providing e-services and a volunteering platform to the workers of the
urban territory and connecting them with citizens and tourists.
● Providing emergency services
● Providing a facility to use Google maps within the SmartGrid to
search through locations of important areas like restaurants, hospitals,
schools, stations and more.
● Making commute and transport easy by providing bus routes and stops
at the SmartGrid panel.

These features will definitely help in solving the problems discussed above
the line, that is, to make urban life easy by incorporating technology and
saving the time and energy of people. Also they are inline with the constraints
that were mentioned, although the lack of education and technological
awareness within the local population is a hurdle but slowly and steadily, we
believe that such a system will make its way in general people’s life by proving
itself an asset for our described utopia.
